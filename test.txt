On the far left of the diagram are the utility methods readAllBytes,
 readAllLines, and the write methods, designed for simple, common cases.
 To the right of those are the methods used to iterate over a stream or lines of text, 
such as newBufferedReader, newBufferedWriter, then newInputStream and newOutputStream. 
These methods are interoperable with the java.io package. To the right of those are the 
methods for dealing with ByteChannels, SeekableByteChannels, and ByteBuffers, such as the newByteChannel method. 
Finally, on the far right are the methods that use FileChannel for advanced applications needing file locking or memory-mapped I/O.
